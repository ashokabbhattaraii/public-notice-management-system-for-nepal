"""Pulls admin-configured LLM API keys/models from apps/api and applies them
to this process, so an admin can rotate a key or switch models from
/admin/settings without a redeploy.

Deliberately pull-based (this service polls the API), not push-based — it's
the same pattern already used for `scraping.summarizeConcurrency`, just on a
timer instead of per-request, since these apply to every LLM call rather
than one scrape run. `config.py`'s module attributes (GROQ_API_KEY,
GEMINI_MODEL, etc.) are mutated in place: every other module reads them via
`config.GROQ_API_KEY` at call time, not a captured copy, so a live update
here takes effect on the very next LLM call with no other code changes.

A field is only overridden when apps/api reports it as actually configured
(non-null) — an admin who has only set a Gemini key must not accidentally
blank out a working Groq key that only exists as an env var here.
