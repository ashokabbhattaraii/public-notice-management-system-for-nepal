"""Shared headless-browser pool for the scraper.

One Chromium instance is launched lazily and reused by every crawl. Callers
take a session through `crawler_session()`, which queues them behind a
process-wide semaphore so only a bounded number of crawls touch the browser at
once. A session that dies with a launch/driver error marks the pool dirty, so
the next caller gets a freshly launched browser instead of a dead handle.
