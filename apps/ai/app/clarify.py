"""Ambiguity gate for corpus-wide notice questions.

"How many are dead?" names no subject. The corpus holds death tolls from
floods, earthquakes, road accidents and fires — each a different number,
each stated by a different notice. Answering from the top-ranked hit
silently picks one of them; adding them up invents a total no notice
states. Both are confidently-delivered wrong answers, and both are what
this module exists to prevent: when the retrieved notices would each give
a *different* answer to the question as asked, ask which one the user
means instead of guessing.

The gate is deliberately two-stage. `looks_underspecified` is a free
regex pre-filter that rules out the overwhelmingly common case (a
question that names its own subject), so the LLM call below only happens
for questions that might actually be ambiguous — no latency tax on
ordinary lookups. `assess` then decides on the *evidence*: it sees the
notices that were actually retrieved, so a clarifying question can only
ever offer choices that exist in the corpus and are therefore answerable.

_ASSESS_PROMPT = """You decide whether a question about a corpus of Nepalese public notices can be answered as asked, or whether it is ambiguous and needs ONE clarifying question first.

You are given the user's question and the notices that were retrieved for it.

Ask for clarification ONLY when ALL of these hold:
1. The question asks for one specific fact — a number, a date, an amount, a name, or a status.
2. The retrieved notices describe two or more DIFFERENT subjects: different incidents, events, disasters, schemes, exams, organisations, or reporting periods.
3. Those different subjects would each give a DIFFERENT answer to the question.

Do NOT ask for clarification when:
- All the notices concern the same subject, even if worded differently, or are follow-up updates on one event.
- The question is broad or exploratory ("what's new", "summarise recent notices", "tell me about floods") — answer those as asked.
- The user explicitly asks for all of them, a total across all, or a comparison.
- Only one notice is genuinely relevant.
- You could answer completely by listing each subject separately in a short answer. Prefer answering over asking.

When you DO ask:
- "question": one short clarifying sentence, in the SAME language as the user's question. Name precisely what is ambiguous.
- "options": 2 to 5 choices drawn STRICTLY from the retrieved notices. Never invent a subject that is not in them.
  - "label": a short human label (max 8 words) naming that specific event or subject. Include the place or date when that is what distinguishes it from the others.
  - "query": the user's original question rewritten to name that subject explicitly, so it can be answered directly on its own.

Return ONLY raw JSON, no prose and no code fences:
{"ambiguous": true, "question": "...", "options": [{"label": "...", "query": "..."}]}
or
{"ambiguous": false}"""
