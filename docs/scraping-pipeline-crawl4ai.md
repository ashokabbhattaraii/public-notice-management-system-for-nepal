# Notice/News Scraping Pipeline (crawl4ai → PostgreSQL)

This document describes the scraping pipeline that replaces the previously
planned **Scrapy + Selenium** stack (see `docs/TechStackByModule.md` §D,
row 22) with **[crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)**, an
open-source, async, Playwright-backed crawler with built-in structured
(CSS/JSON) extraction.

**This is a dynamic, multi-source pipeline.** An admin adds *any*
government/public website from the dashboard — a name, a base URL, one or two
listing page URLs (Notice / News), and (optionally) that site's pagination
scheme. There is no per-site code to write: the extraction pattern (which DOM
elements are list rows, which is the title/link/date) is **detected
automatically** on first run and **cached** for every run after that.
Scrape runs are triggered on demand and report **live status messages**
("Crawling Notice listing, page 2…", "Fetching detail: …") back to the
dashboard while they run, rather than being an opaque spinner.
`mofa.gov.np` (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nepal) is the first source
seeded into the system, but it is configured through the same admin UI as
any other source — see [§2](#2-how-dynamic-detection-works) (detection) and
[§6.4](#64-configurable-pagination--live-progress) (pagination & progress).

Services involved:

- **web** (`apps/web`) — Admin → Scraping dashboard: add/edit/disable/delete sources, trigger runs, view logs
- **api** (`apps/api`) — NestJS: owns `ScrapeSource`/`ScrapedItem`/`ScrapeRun` tables, orchestrates detection→cache, dedup/upsert, admin auth
- **ai** (`apps/ai`) — Python ASGI: runs the crawl4ai crawl + schema detection, returns structured JSON
- **PostgreSQL** — system of record for sources, scraped notices/news, and run history (via Prisma)

## 1. Why crawl4ai (vs. the originally planned Scrapy/Selenium)

| Concern | Scrapy + Selenium (old plan) | crawl4ai (as-built) |
|---|---|---|
| JS-rendered pages | Selenium only, separate driver/browser management | Native, Playwright-backed (`AsyncWebCrawler`) |
| Structured extraction | Hand-rolled `XPath`/`BeautifulSoup` per site | `JsonCssExtractionStrategy` — declarative CSS→JSON schema |
| Async/concurrency | Scrapy's own reactor (Twisted) | Native `asyncio`, integrates directly with the ASGI service |
| Two-tool glue code | Scrapy for crawling + Selenium for JS + BS4 for parsing | One library end-to-end |
| Maintenance surface | 3 libraries to version together | 1 library |

crawl4ai lives entirely inside `apps/ai` (Python), consistent with the
project's existing rule that **Python owns crawling/AI/ML**, and NestJS
remains the trusted gateway that owns persistence (see
`docs/TechStackByModule.md` §4.2–4.3).

---

## 2. How dynamic detection works

Arbitrary government/public sites have arbitrary markup — a hand-written CSS
schema per site (the original MOFA-only implementation) doesn't scale to "any
site an admin adds." Detection runs in three tiers, cheapest first:

```
1. Cached schema (free)         — reuse ScrapeSource.noticeSchema/newsSchema
                                   from a previous successful run
2. LLM-assisted detection        — only runs when there's no cached schema
   (paid once, then cached)       yet, or the cached schema suddenly returns
                                   zero rows (site markup changed). Uses
                                   Groq (GROQ_API_KEY, already configured for
                                   RAG) to read the page once and propose a
                                   schema. Explicitly instructed to prefer a
                                   real `<table>` of notices over "recent
                                   posts" sidebar widgets that duplicate
                                   across a site's pages.
3. Structural heuristics (free)  — if there's no LLM key configured, or the
   fallback                       LLM's proposed schema also yields zero
                                   rows: group sibling DOM elements by
                                   tag+class, score groups by repetition
                                   count and list-like class names ("row",
                                   "card", "item", "list", …), penalize
                                   nav/footer/pagination-like groups, then
                                   derive title/link/date field selectors
                                   from the winning group's first element.
```

Whichever schema actually produces rows is returned to NestJS, which
persists it on the `ScrapeSource` row (`noticeSchema/newsSchema`, JSON
columns storing a `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`-shaped schema). **Every
subsequent run reuses that cached schema — pure CSS extraction, no LLM calls,
no heuristics** — until the site's markup changes enough that the cached
schema returns zero rows, at which point detection re-runs automatically.

This is the "optimized" part of the design: detection cost (an LLM call, or
a DOM-scan) is paid at most once per source per site redesign, not on every
scheduled run.

**Escape hatch:** heuristics and even LLM detection can guess wrong on
unusual markup (see [§9](#9-known-limitations--future-work)). There is no
manual schema override in the admin UI yet — a source that repeatedly
detects the wrong DOM group needs a code-level fix or a direct
`UPDATE scrape_sources SET notice_schema = '{...}'` with a hand-written
schema. Adding an "Advanced: paste CSS schema JSON" field to the Add/Edit
Source dialog is the natural next step (see Suggestions).

**Detail-page content is not schema-based at all.** Article/detail pages
across arbitrary sites vary too much for a reusable per-site body selector.
Instead, `_crawl_detail_generic()` (`apps/ai/app/scraper.py`) fetches the
page, strips obvious chrome (`script`, `style`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`,
`aside`), and picks the first matching container from a priority list of
common article-body selectors (`article`, `main`, `[role="main"]`,
`.entry-content`, `.details__desc`, …), falling back to the whole
chrome-stripped page. `<h1>` is used for the title and `<time>` for the
published date as a fallback when the listing row didn't carry a date.

---

## 3. Target site anatomy — `mofa.gov.np` (the seeded example source)

| Category | Listing URL | Nav label | DOM shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NOTICE` | `/category/information/?page=N` | "Notice" | `<table class="table"><tbody><tr>…` — one row per item |
| `NEWS` | `/category/presscategory/?page=N` | "Press Release" | `<div class="category-1-grid"><div class="grid__card">…` — one card per item |

Both paginate via a `?page=N` query string, generalized in
`_paginated_url()` (works for any site using this common convention; sites
that don't will simply stop after page 1 returns no *new* rows).

> ⚠️ Note the `/category/automatic-publishing-notice/` URL is **not** the
> "Notice" nav item — that path is actually "Proactive Disclosure". The
> correct "Notice" category is `/category/information/`. Confirmed by
> resolving the nav-bar `<a>` tags, not by guessing from the URL slug.

> ⚠️ **Bikram Sambat / Gregorian date variance — not a JS issue.** MOFA's
> listing pages serve published dates in **either** Gregorian English
> (`"Sunday, June 07, 2026, 09:07 PM"`) **or** Bikram Sambat Devanagari
> (`"जेठ २४, २०८३, आइतबार २१:७"`, or day-first as `"२३ असार, २०८३"`) —
> confirmed via response headers (`X-Cache-Language: ne`/`en`, `Vary:
> Accept-Language`) to be a **Varnish CDN cache-variant split**, not something
> controllable via `Accept-Language` headers, Playwright locale settings, or
> disabling JavaScript (all three were tried and made no difference — the
> CDN serves whichever variant happens to be cached, regardless of the
> request). The fix is parsing **both** calendars rather than avoiding one:
> `_parse_bs_date()` in `apps/ai/app/scraper.py` converts Devanagari-numeral
> BS dates to Gregorian via the `nepali_datetime` library, handling both
> "month day, year" and "day month, year" token orders (different MOFA
> templates use different orders for the same data). This matters for any
> Nepali government site aggregated by this pipeline, not just MOFA.

**Dedup strategy:** `sourceUrl` (the absolute detail-page URL) is the unique
key across *all* sources — a global uniqueness constraint, not scoped per
source, so the same article URL can never be double-stored even if two
sources happened to reference it. `contentHash` (`sha256(title +
content_text)`) detects when a previously-scraped page has been edited, so a
re-run **updates** the row instead of silently skipping it or duplicating it.

`sourceLabel` is a denormalized snapshot of `ScrapeSource.name` at scrape
time, so items/runs still render sensibly if a source is later deleted
(`sourceId` cascades to `NULL`... actually cascades the *delete*, per
`onDelete: Cascade` — deleting a source deletes its items/runs. See
[§9](#9-known-limitations--future-work) for the tradeoff this implies).

> This schema was applied with `prisma db push` rather than
> `prisma migrate dev`, because the existing migration history in this repo
> had already drifted from the live database (the `Intern`/`Attendance`
> models were added the same way). Do not run `migrate dev` /
> `migrate reset` against this database — it will attempt to drop and
> recreate the schema. Use `db push` for further schema changes here until
> the migration history is reconciled.

The MOFA source was seeded directly (not through the admin UI, since it
pre-dates this multi-source version) with a fixed id
(`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`), and the 35 items/1 run already
scraped in the earlier MOFA-only version of this pipeline were backfilled
onto it (`sourceId` was previously `NULL` for those rows).

## 6. Python AI service (`apps/ai`)

### 6.1 `app/scraper.py`

Key functions:

- **`_detect_schema_heuristic(html, base_url)`** — groups sibling elements by
  tag+class signature, scores by row count and list-like class hints
  (`row`/`item`/`card`/`list`/`entry`/`result`/`post`/`notice`/`news`),
  penalizes nav/footer/pagination-like groups, then within the winning
  group: picks the best detail-page anchor (excludes file attachments and
  external/CDN links, scores by digit/path-depth heuristics that correlate
  with "this is an article ID link"), the longest non-date non-numeric text
  block for the title, and a `<time>` tag or date-class element (or a
  regex-matched date-like text node) for the published date.
- **`_detect_schema_llm(html, category)`** — sends the chrome-stripped HTML
  (truncated to 30,000 chars) to Groq with a prompt that explicitly asks it
  to prefer a real notice/news `<table>` over recurring "recent posts"
  widgets, and to return a `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`-shaped JSON schema.
  Returns `None` (falls through to heuristics) if no `GROQ_API_KEY` is
  configured, the call fails, or the response isn't valid JSON.
- **`_resolve_schema(crawler, listing_url, category, cached_schema)`** — the
  tiered lookup described in [§2](#2-how-dynamic-detection-works); returns
  `(schema, is_newly_detected)`.
- **`_crawl_detail_generic(crawler, url)`** — schema-free detail-page
  extraction (see [§2](#2-how-dynamic-detection-works)).
- **`_parse_published(raw)`** / **`_parse_bs_date(raw)`** — Gregorian format
  list plus Bikram Sambat parsing via `nepali_datetime` (see
  [§3](#3-target-site-anatomy--mofagovnp-the-seeded-example-source)).
- **`scrape_source(base_url, category_urls, cached_schemas, known_urls,
  max_pages, fetch_detail, pagination, on_progress)`** — the public
  orchestration entry point:
  1. Opens one `AsyncWebCrawler` (headless Chromium via Playwright, JS
     **enabled** — many admin-added sites render listings client-side) for
     the whole run.
  2. For each category present in `category_urls`, resolves a working schema
     (cached → LLM → heuristic) once, then crawls listing pages built by
     `_paginated_url()` according to `pagination` (see
     [§6.4](#64-configurable-pagination--live-progress)), stopping early once
     a page yields no rows not already seen this run.
  3. For each listing row, resolves the absolute detail URL. If it's **not**
     in `known_urls` (not already in Postgres), fetches the detail page for
     full content generically; otherwise keeps the listing-only summary —
     the main cost-control lever, since detail fetches are the expensive
     part of each run.
  4. Calls `on_progress(message)` at each meaningful step (schema resolution,
     each listing page, each detail fetch, completion) if provided — this is
     what powers the admin dashboard's live status feed.
  5. Returns `(items: list[ScrapedItem], schemas_used: dict[str, dict])` —
     the schemas are handed back so the caller can persist them.

### 6.2 Route: `POST /scrape/source`

Added to `apps/ai/app/main.py`'s hand-rolled ASGI router (`_route`),
matching the existing pattern used by `/query`, `/documents`, etc.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "base_url": "https://mofa.gov.np",
  "category_urls": {
    "NOTICE": "https://mofa.gov.np/category/information/",
    "NEWS": "https://mofa.gov.np/category/presscategory/"
  },
  "cached_schemas": { "NOTICE": { "baseSelector": "table.table tbody tr", "fields": [...] } },
  "known_urls": ["https://mofa.gov.np/content/1820/.../", "..."],
  "max_pages": 3,
  "run_id": "a3f1...-uuid-of-the-ScrapeRun-row",
  "pagination": { "type": "QUERY_PARAM", "param": "page", "start_page": 1 }
}
```

`run_id` and `pagination` are both optional — omitting `run_id` skips progress
recording (used by the manual `curl` test in [§10](#10-manual-test-checklist));
omitting `pagination` defaults to `{type: "QUERY_PARAM", param: "page",
start_page: 1}`, matching the original MOFA-only behavior.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "category": "NOTICE",
      "title": "Attention: Application for the position of Ambassador",
      "source_url": "https://mofa.gov.np/content/1820/attention--application-for-the-position-of-ambassador/",
      "published_at": "2026-06-02T16:27:00",
      "summary": "Thank you for your overwhelming response...",
      "content_text": "Thank you for your overwhelming response...",
      "content_html": "<div class=\"details__desc\">...</div>",
      "attachment_url": null
    }
  ],
  "schemas": {
    "NOTICE": { "baseSelector": "table.table tbody tr", "fields": [...], "name": "llm_detected" }
  }
}
```

`schemas` only contains entries for categories where a schema was actually
used (cached-and-still-working, or freshly detected) — the caller persists
these onto the `ScrapeSource` row regardless of whether they changed, since
writing the same JSON back is harmless and simpler than diffing.

Errors from the crawl (network failure, no working schema found) return
`502`/`400` with an `error` message; the NestJS side surfaces this as a
`FAILED` `ScrapeRun` rather than throwing an unhandled 500.

### 6.3 Route: `GET /scrape/progress/{run_id}`

Polled by NestJS (proxied to the admin dashboard) while a run is in flight.

**Response (mid-run):**
```json
{
  "run_id": "a3f1...",
  "stage": "running",
  "messages": [
    { "at": 1783675306.4, "text": "Resolving extraction pattern for Notice…" },
    { "at": 1783675311.0, "text": "Crawling Notice listing, page 1…" },
    { "at": 1783675312.2, "text": "Fetching detail: Attention: Application for the position of Ambassador" }
  ],
  "error": null,
  "started_at": 1783675304.9,
  "updated_at": 1783675312.2
}
```

`stage` is `"running"`, `"done"`, or `"failed"`; `404` if the AI service has
no record of that `run_id` (never started, or evicted — see
[§6.4](#64-configurable-pagination--live-progress)).

### 6.4 Configurable pagination & live progress

**Pagination.** `_paginated_url(listing_url, page_index, config)` in
`scraper.py` builds each listing page's URL from a `PaginationConfig`
(`pagination_type`, `param`, `start_page`), mirroring the admin-configurable
`ScrapeSource` columns:

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `QUERY_PARAM` (default) | Appends `?<param>=<n>` (or `&` if the URL already has a query string). Covers the common `?page=2`, `?start=20`, etc. |
| `PATH_TEMPLATE` | Substitutes a literal `{page}` token anywhere in the listing URL, e.g. `.../notices/page/{page}/`. If no `{page}` token is present, behaves like a single page rather than silently repeating page 1. |
| `NONE` | Always a single page, regardless of `maxPages`. |

`page_index` is 0-based; the actual page number sent to the site is
`start_page + page_index`, so a site whose first page is `?page=0` (rather
than `1`) is handled by setting `startPage: 0` on the source.

**Live progress.** `apps/ai/app/scrape_progress.py` mirrors the existing
`app/progress.py` (used for document-ingestion progress) but tracks a
rolling **message log** per `run_id` rather than a percent bar — a scrape
run's useful status is "what's happening right now" (which category, which
page, which detail page), not a smooth percentage. Entries are process-local
and evicted after 15 minutes past completion (same TTL/cap pattern as
`progress.py`), which is fine since the authoritative run result lives in
Postgres (`ScrapeRun`).

This only works because `ScrapingService.runSource()` (NestJS) is
**fire-and-forget**: it creates the `ScrapeRun` row, kicks off the AI call
without awaiting it in the request path, and returns `{ runId }`
immediately. The web dashboard then polls `GET
/admin/scraping/runs/:id/progress` (which proxies to `GET
/scrape/progress/{run_id}` on the AI service) every ~1.2s and renders the
message feed live under the source's card, stopping once `stage` is `"done"`
or `"failed"`.

### 6.5 Dependencies

Added to `apps/ai/requirements.txt`:

```
crawl4ai>=0.6.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
nepali-datetime>=1.0.5
```

**One-time setup** after `pip install -r requirements.txt` — crawl4ai needs
its Playwright browser binaries installed:

```bash
cd apps/ai
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
crawl4ai-setup        # downloads headless Chromium for Playwright
crawl4ai-doctor        # sanity-checks the install
```

Without this step, `AsyncWebCrawler` will fail at runtime with a Playwright
"executable doesn't exist" error — this is separate from `pip install`
succeeding.

## 7. NestJS API (`apps/api`)

### 7.1 `ScrapingService` (`src/services/scraping.service.ts`)

- **Source CRUD:** `listSources()` (with item counts via `_count`),
  `getSource(id)`, `createSource(input)` (requires at least one of
  `noticeListUrl`/`newsListUrl`), `updateSource(id, input)` (changing a
  listing URL clears that category's cached schema — the old selectors were
  derived from the old page), `deleteSource(id)` (cascades to its items/runs
  via the FK).
- **`runSource(id, categories?)`** — **fire-and-forget**: creates the
  `ScrapeRun` row (`status=RUNNING`), kicks off `executeRun()` without
  awaiting it, and returns `{ runId }` immediately. This lets the caller
  (the admin dashboard) start polling progress right away instead of
  blocking on the whole crawl.
  1. Guards against overlapping runs **per source** with an in-memory
     `Set<sourceId>` (different sources can run concurrently; the same
     source can't run twice at once). Single-instance assumption — see
     [§9](#9-known-limitations--future-work).
- **`executeRun(runId, source, categories?)`** (private) — the actual work,
  detached from the request/response cycle:
  1. Builds `category_urls` from the source's configured listing URLs,
     `cached_schemas` from `source.noticeSchema`/`newsSchema`, and
     `known_urls` from all `ScrapedItem.sourceUrl`s already stored for this
     `sourceId`.
  2. POSTs to `${AI_SERVICE_URL}/scrape/source` with `max_pages`, `run_id:
     runId`, and a `pagination` object built from the source's
     `paginationType`/`paginationParam`/`startPage` columns (same
     `HttpService` + `ConfigService` pattern as `RagService`/
     `DocumentsService`), 10-minute timeout (raised from 5 to accommodate
     sources configured for more pages/detail fetches).
  3. For each returned item, hashes `title + content_text`, and either
     inserts a new `ScrapedItem`, updates one whose hash changed, or skips
     an unchanged one.
  4. Updates the `ScrapeRun` to `SUCCESS` with counts (or `FAILED` with the
     error message), and updates the `ScrapeSource` row's `lastRunAt`,
     `lastStatus`, and any schemas returned — all in a `finally` block that
     also clears the per-source running lock.
- **`getRunProgress(runId)`** — proxies `GET
  ${AI_SERVICE_URL}/scrape/progress/{runId}` with a short 5s timeout;
  returns an empty `{ messages: [] }` shell instead of throwing if the AI
  service is unreachable, so a flaky poll doesn't break the dashboard.
- `listItems(sourceId?, category?, page, limit)` /
  `listRuns(sourceId?, limit)` — paginated reads for the admin dashboard,
  optionally scoped to one source.

### 7.2 `ScrapingController` (`src/controllers/scraping.controller.ts`)

All routes are under `/admin/scraping` and gated by
`@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` + `@Roles(Role.admin)` (same pattern
as other admin-only routes in this codebase):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/admin/scraping/sources` | List all configured sources with item counts |
| `POST` | `/admin/scraping/sources` | Add a new source (`name`, `baseUrl`, `noticeListUrl?`, `newsListUrl?`, `paginationType?`, `paginationParam?`, `startPage?`, `maxPages?`) |
| `PATCH` | `/admin/scraping/sources/:id` | Edit a source, or toggle `enabled` |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/scraping/sources/:id` | Remove a source (cascades to its items/runs) |
| `POST` | `/admin/scraping/sources/:id/run` | Trigger a scrape run — returns `{ runId }` immediately (body: `{ categories?: ["NOTICE","NEWS"] }`) |
| `GET` | `/admin/scraping/runs/:id/progress` | Live status messages for an in-flight (or just-finished) run |
| `GET` | `/admin/scraping/items` | Paginated, filterable list of scraped notices/news (`?sourceId=&category=&search=&dateFrom=&dateTo=&sortBy=&sortOrder=&page=&limit=`) |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/scraping/items/:id` | Remove a single scraped item |
| `GET` | `/admin/scraping/runs` | Recent run history (`?sourceId=&limit=`), for the Logs tab |

### 7.3 `ScrapingModule`

Registers `HttpModule.register({ timeout: 300000 })` and is wired into
`AppModule` alongside the other feature modules. Unchanged by this revision
— note `executeRun`'s own HTTP call to `/scrape/source` overrides this with a
10-minute timeout per-request (see 7.1), since the module-level default is
now mostly a floor for other calls like `getRunProgress`.

---

## 8. Web admin dashboard (`apps/web/app/admin/scraping`)

Rebuilt from a 100%-mock scaffold into a fully live CRUD page:

- **Sources tab:** one card per `ScrapeSource`, each with its enabled/failed
  status badge, categories configured, item count, pagination summary (e.g.
  `?page=N · up to 3 pages`), last-run timestamp, and **Run now** /
  **Enable-Disable** / **Edit** / **Delete** actions, all calling the real
  API.
  - **Add/Edit source dialog:** `name`, `baseUrl`, the two optional listing
    URLs, and a collapsible **Advanced: pagination** section (pagination
    style select — Query parameter / Path template / No pagination — plus
    the query-param name, start page, and max pages per run, shown
    conditionally on the selected style).
  - **Live progress while running:** clicking **Run now** immediately shows
    a small scrolling message panel on that source's card, polling `GET
    /admin/scraping/runs/:id/progress` every 1.2s and rendering the last few
    status lines (e.g. "Crawling Notice listing, page 2…", "Fetching
    detail: …") until the run finishes, at which point the card refreshes
    with the final item count/status.
- **Logs tab:** real run history across all sources from `GET
  /admin/scraping/runs`, refreshable, showing "Scraping…" for runs still in
  progress.

The stat tiles (active sources, total sources, scraped items, errors) are
computed from the live `sources` list rather than hardcoded. The old
mock-only "Config" tab (fake timeout/retry sliders with no backing
implementation) was removed rather than left as dead UI implying
unimplemented settings.

New/changed client helpers in `apps/web/lib/api.ts`:

```ts
fetchScrapeSources()
createScrapeSource(input)     // input now includes paginationType/paginationParam/startPage/maxPages
updateScrapeSource(id, input)
deleteScrapeSource(id)
runScrapeSource(id, categories?)      // returns { runId } immediately
fetchScrapeRunProgress(runId)         // poll while a run is in flight
fetchScrapedItems(filters)            // sourceId/category/search/dateFrom/dateTo/sortBy/sortOrder/page/limit
deleteScrapedItem(id)
fetchScrapeRuns(sourceId?, limit)
```

`ScrapeSource` was added to `apps/web/lib/types.ts`; `ScrapedItem`/`ScrapeRun`
were updated to carry `sourceId`/`sourceLabel` instead of the old flat
`source: string`.

## 9. Known limitations & future work

- **No manual schema override yet.** When both LLM detection and heuristics
  pick the wrong repeating-element group (observed on `mofa.gov.np`'s News
  page, whose "recent posts" sidebar widget structurally resembles the real
  grid), there's no admin-facing way to correct it short of a direct
  database update. **Suggested fix:** add an optional "Advanced: paste CSS
  schema JSON" field to the Add/Edit Source dialog that, when present,
  bypasses detection entirely for that category.
- **Heuristic/LLM detection can still misfire on unusual markup.** The
  heuristic scorer is a reasonable generalist (table rows, list items, card
  grids) but is not guaranteed to find the right group on every possible
  site layout; the LLM path is materially more reliable when a `GROQ_API_KEY`
  is configured (which it is, by default, for this project's RAG feature)
  but is still a best-effort read of one page, not a guarantee.
- **Scheduling:** this phase only wires a manual "Run now" trigger per
  source. `.env` already reserves `SCRAPING_INTERVAL_CRON` and
  `SCRAPING_CONCURRENCY` for a future `@nestjs/schedule` cron job that loops
  over enabled sources and calls `runSource()` — not yet implemented.
- **Single-instance run lock:** `ScrapingService`'s overlap guard is an
  in-memory `Set`. If the API ever runs as multiple replicas, this needs to
  move to a DB-backed or Redis-backed lock (e.g. a `RUNNING` row check with a
  stale-run timeout) so two replicas can't scrape the same source
  concurrently.
- **Deleting a source deletes its history.** `onDelete: Cascade` on
  `ScrapedItem`/`ScrapeRun` means removing a misconfigured source also wipes
  everything it ever scraped. A "soft delete" (keep `enabled=false` instead
  of hard-deleting) is probably the safer default admin action; consider
  changing the "Delete" button to a disable-only action and adding a
  separate, more clearly destructive "Purge" action for actual deletion.
- **No alerting/classification yet:** scraped items land in `scraped_items`
  as-is; the "AI-powered" categorization/summarization/alerts-matching
  described in `docs/TechStackByModule.md` (rows 21, 24) is not part of this
  phase.
- **Public Notices UI still uses `mockNotices`:** `apps/web/app/admin/notices`
  was wired to `scraped_items` (with search/category/source/date-range
  filtering and sorting) in a later revision, but the **public-facing**
  `apps/web/app/notices` pages are unchanged. Wiring those to real scraped
  data is a natural next step once more than one source has meaningful
  volume.
- **Pagination config doesn't cover "load more"/infinite-scroll sites.**
  `ScrapePaginationType` handles URL-addressable pagination (`?page=N`,
  `/page/N/`, or none); sites that only reveal more rows via a JS "Load
  more" button or infinite scroll (no distinct URL per page) aren't
  supported yet — that would need `js_code`/`scan_full_page`-style crawl4ai
  interaction scripting, not just a different URL template.
- **Progress messages are ephemeral and single-process.** `scrape_progress`
  state lives in the AI service's memory, keyed by `run_id`; an AI service
  restart mid-run loses the message log (the `ScrapeRun` row's final
  SUCCESS/FAILED status is still recorded correctly by NestJS once/if the
  HTTP call completes or errors). If the AI service ever runs as multiple
  replicas, progress polling would need to be sticky-routed to whichever
  replica is running that scrape, or moved to a shared store (Redis).
- **robots.txt / rate limiting:** crawl4ai does not automatically throttle
  requests to a single host; the current implementation crawls sequentially
  (one page/detail fetch at a time within a single `AsyncWebCrawler`
  session), which is gentle by construction, but there's no explicit
  per-host delay or `robots.txt` check yet. Add `mean_delay`/`max_range` via
  crawl4ai's rate-limiting options before onboarding sources with stricter
  crawl policies, and consider checking `robots.txt` before adding a new
  source (surface a warning in the Add Source dialog, at minimum).
- **`attachment_url` is not extracted generically.** The original
  MOFA-specific schema captured a PDF/image attachment link per row; the
  generic listing schema (auto-detected) does not attempt this, since
  "which link is the attachment vs. the detail link" is exactly what
  `_pick_detail_anchor` already has to disambiguate, and doing it reliably
  for *both* purposes at once was out of scope for this pass.
- **Detail-page content can include minor boilerplate.** The generic content
  extractor picks the best matching container (`article`, `main`,
  `.entry-content`, etc.) but on sites without a tightly-scoped content
  wrapper (MOFA's own template wraps the whole `<main>`, including the
  title, date, and font-size toggle buttons, rather than isolating the body
  in its own container) some non-article text can bleed into
  `content_text`/`content_html`. This does not affect title/date/link
  accuracy, only the fidelity of the stored body text.

## 10. Manual test checklist

1. `cd apps/ai && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && crawl4ai-setup`
2. Start the AI service: `pnpm dev:ai` (or `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`)
3. `curl -X POST localhost:8000/scrape/source -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"base_url":"https://mofa.gov.np","category_urls":{"NOTICE":"https://mofa.gov.np/category/information/"},"cached_schemas":{},"known_urls":[],"max_pages":2,"run_id":"test-1","pagination":{"type":"QUERY_PARAM","param":"page","start_page":1}}'` — confirm JSON `items[]` spans both pages (12 items, not 6) and includes a `schemas.NOTICE` object.
4. While that request is in flight, in another terminal: `curl localhost:8000/scrape/progress/test-1` — confirm a growing `messages[]` list ("Crawling Notice listing, page 1…", "Fetching detail: …", …) and `stage: "running"`; after the request completes, confirm `stage: "done"`.
5. Start the API: `pnpm dev:api`. Confirm `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` is applied (`pnpm exec prisma db push` from `apps/api`).
6. Log in to the web app as an admin user, open **Admin → Scraping**. Confirm the seeded "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)" source card appears with its real item count.
7. Click **Add source**, expand **Advanced: pagination**, set a pagination style/param/start page/max pages for a second government/public site, save, then click **Run now** on its card — confirm the live message panel appears under the card and updates every ~1.2s, then clears once the run finishes and the card shows the final item count/status.
8. Confirm the Logs tab shows the run with `itemsNew`/`itemsFound`, and shows "Scraping…" for any run still in progress.
9. Re-run the same source — confirm `itemsNew` drops to ~0 (only genuinely new posts) and check AI service logs for `Cached schema for ... yielded no rows` (should **not** appear — the cached schema should keep working) and no new LLM/heuristic detection log lines.
10. Toggle **Disable** on a source and confirm **Run now** becomes unavailable; **Enable** it again and confirm it becomes runnable.
11. Open **Admin → Notices**, filter by the new source and a date range, and confirm only its matching items appear.
12. Delete a source and confirm its card disappears and its items/runs are gone from both the Logs tab and Admin → Notices.

## Suggestions for next iterations

Ranked roughly by impact-to-effort:

1. **Manual schema override field** in the Add/Edit Source dialog (see
   [§9](#9-known-limitations--future-work)) — the single highest-leverage
   fix for the "detection picked the wrong widget" failure mode, and turns
   this from "usually works automatically" into "always works, with a
   documented manual fallback."
2. **Scheduling via `@nestjs/schedule`.** Loop over `enabled` sources on a
   cron (`SCRAPING_INTERVAL_CRON`), calling `runSource()` for each with a
   per-source `lastRunAt`-based backoff so a slow/failing source doesn't
   block others. This is the difference between "admin remembers to click
   Run" and an actually autonomous pipeline.
3. **Soft-delete sources** instead of cascading hard-deletes, so disabling a
   bad source doesn't destroy its scrape history.
4. **`robots.txt` check on Add Source**, surfaced as a warning (not a hard
   block) — keeps the admin honest about crawl policy without adding a
   backend dependency.
5. **Per-host rate limiting** (`mean_delay`/`max_range` in crawl4ai's
   `CrawlerRunConfig`) once more than a couple of sources are onboarded, so
   simultaneous admin-triggered runs against different hosts don't
   accidentally hammer any single site.
6. **Wire the public Notices pages to `scraped_items`** — `apps/web/app/admin/notices`
   already made this switch; `apps/web/app/notices` (the public-facing pages)
   are the remaining piece, once there's enough real volume across sources
   to make it worthwhile.
7. **Attachment URL extraction** for the generic listing schema, reusing the
   same "exclude file-extension/external links" logic already in
   `_pick_detail_anchor`, but capturing *both* the detail link and any
   attachment link per row instead of just one.
8. **Cross-instance run locking** (Redis or a DB row lock with a stale-run
   timeout) before this ever runs as more than one API replica — also needed
   for `scrape_progress` (see [§9](#9-known-limitations--future-work)) once
   the AI service itself is scaled beyond one process.
9. **Content-container quality**: extend `_CONTENT_SELECTORS` with more
   patterns as real-world sources reveal gaps, or add a lightweight
   "is this line boilerplate" filter (e.g. drop very short lines matching
   common chrome text like "Share", "Print", "A A A" font-size togglers)
   before storing `content_text`.
10. **"Load more"/infinite-scroll pagination support** — a fourth
    `ScrapePaginationType` (e.g. `JS_INTERACTION`) driving crawl4ai's
    `js_code`/`scan_full_page` options to click a "load more" button or
    scroll until no new rows appear, for sites with no URL-addressable pages.
11. **Progress-message quality**: currently every detail fetch logs its
    title; on a source with `maxPages` set high this can produce a long
    message list. Consider collapsing to periodic "N/M items fetched"
    summaries once a page's row count is known upfront, keeping per-item
    detail only for the most recent few.
